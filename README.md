### Hi there 👋

🜸 **System & Workflow**  
- Daily driver: 🐧 **Arch Linux** + **Wayland**  
- Text editors: ⚙️ **Neovim** & **Helix**, fine-tuned for precision  
- Interface: Pure **CLI** & **TUI** — because control belongs to the keyboard  

🜸 **Programming Focus**  
- 💎 **Dart & Flutter** — building robust, elegant UIs  
- 🌀 **Lua** — crafting Neovim plugins & automation tools  
- ⚡ **Bash** — system scripting & environment customization  

🜸 **What I Love**  
- Creating terminal-based tools that *feel alive*  
- Exploring the boundaries between **system engineering** and **developer experience**  
- Building a cohesive, efficient workflow entirely inside the terminal  

📂 *Open to collaboration on terminal tools, Neovim plugins, and cross-platform Flutter apps.*
